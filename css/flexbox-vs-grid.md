# Flexbox vs Grid

## ðŸ‘‡ Use Flexbox When:
- You need a **1-dimensional** layout (row OR column)
- You want to align items easily in one direction
- Elements need to wrap or align based on content

## ðŸ‘‡ Use CSS Grid When:
- You need a **2-dimensional** layout (row AND column)
- You want full control of both axes
- Layout depends on **space**, not content size

## ðŸ§  Summary:
Flexbox is great for alignment; Grid is great for layout.
