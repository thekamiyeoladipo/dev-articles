# 🧠 Dev Articles & Learning Notes

Welcome to my developer article repository! 👋  
This is where I document what I learn as a **front-end developer**. Whether it's concepts, tips, bugs I've solved, or summaries of tricky topics — it's all here.

## 📚 Topics Covered

- ⚛️ React
- 🎨 CSS
- 📜 JavaScript
- 💼 Career & Interview Prep
- 🗒️ Daily Logs & Notes

## ✍️ Why I Do This

Some days I write code, other days I write about code.  
This repo helps me:
- Stay consistent with GitHub contributions 💚
- Track what I've learned
- Share knowledge with others

## ✅ How It's Organized

Each folder contains articles or notes on that subject. Most files are in Markdown (`.md`) for easy readability.

## 📅 Daily Writing Habit

Even on lazy days, I try to:
- Reflect on one topic
- Summarize it in 5–10 lines
- Commit & push here

## 📢 Contributions

You're welcome to fork, share, or suggest edits via Pull Requests.
